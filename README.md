# My portfolio

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). I also used the npm package [gh-pages](https://github.com/tschaub/gh-pages) and followed this [tutorial](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages) to deploy to Github Pages.

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
Other commands:

### `npm test`

### `npm run build`

### `npm run eject`

To deploy to Github Pages (per tutorial above):

### `npm run deploy`
